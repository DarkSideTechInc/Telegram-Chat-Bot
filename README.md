Hello Guys sorry if my Instructions Are a bit confusingðŸ˜…. Its my First Time Uploading Here !! But i will do better i promise 

# Telegram-Chat-Bot
A chatbot implemented in Python using the Telegram Bot API and the python-telegram-bot library:


How To Get Bot Token:
Chat with BotFather:Open Telegram and search for "@BotFather" in the search bar.

Start a chat with BotFather by clicking on it and then clicking on the "Start" button.

Create a New Bot:Type "/newbot" to BotFather to create a new bot.

Follow the instructions provided by BotFather to set up your bot. 

You'll need to provide a name for your bot and a username (which must end with "bot").

Obtain the API Token:After creating the bot, BotFather will provide you with a token. 

This token is your Telegram Bot API key.Copy the token and keep it secure. 

Do not share it with anyone else as it grants access to your bot's functionality.Add the API Token to Your Code:Open your Python script (Telegram_Chat_Bot.py in this case) in a text editor.

Locate the line where the Updater object is created. It should look something like this:
updater = Updater("YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY")

Replace "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_API_KEY" with the API token provided by BotFather.Save and Run:Save your changes to the Python script.Run your bot script again to apply the changes.

Setting up a webhook for your Telegram bot allows you to receive updates from Telegram via HTTPS requests, which is more efficient and reliable than constantly polling for updates.

Here's how you can set up a webhook for your bot:Choose a Server to Host Your Bot:You need a server with a publicly accessible HTTPS endpoint to set up the webhook. 

This can be a cloud server, a VPS, or any other server that you have control over.Prepare Your Bot Code:Ensure that your bot code is ready and includes the necessary setup to handle webhook requests. 

This typically involves initializing the Updater object with the webhook URL and starting the webhook server.Get a Domain Name (Optional):If you don't have a domain name, you can use the public IP address of your server. However, having a domain name is recommended for easier management and better user experience.

Set Up SSL Certificate (Required for Webhooks):Telegram requires that the webhook URL uses HTTPS and has a valid SSL certificate. You can obtain an SSL certificate from a certificate authority (CA) or use a free service like Let's Encrypt.

Configure Your Bot to Use Webhooks:Update your bot code to use webhooks instead of polling for updates. Initialize the Updater object with the webhook URL and port, and start the webhook server.

Ensure that your bot code is listening for HTTPS requests on the specified webhook URL.Set the Webhook URL:Use the Telegram Bot API to set the webhook URL for your bot. You can do this by sending a request to the Telegram API with your bot's token and the webhook URL.

Verify the Webhook Setup:Once the webhook is set up, Telegram will send a request to the specified URL to verify the connection. 

Make sure that your server responds correctly to this request with a HTTP 200 OK response.Test Your Bot:Test your bot by sending messages to it via Telegram. 

You should see the bot responding to messages in real-time.Monitor and Maintain:Monitor your bot's performance and make necessary adjustments as needed. Ensure that your server remains operational and the webhook endpoint is accessible.

Setting up a webhook requires some technical knowledge and server administration skills. 

If you're not familiar with these concepts, you may need to seek assistance from someone with experience in web development and server management.
